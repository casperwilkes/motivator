These font files are used for creating motivational posters. If you want to 
change the fonts used, add others for selection, you should add them in this 
directory. 

If you have added or changed the fonts used, you should also modify the 
system/includes/generator.php file as well. The variables you are looking to 
modify for the title and message text.

1.) $title_font
2.) $message_font

Changing the variable will modify the fonts used.
