#The [M]otivator - Create your own motivational posters

##Purpose
The purpose of the application is for the easy creation of motivational posters. 
A user selects an image, adds a motivational title and an optional message. After
the information is uploaded a poster is created. If the user is satisfied with 
the results, they can then download the newly created poster.

##Requirements
- Uses [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.com/script/index.php) software
 - Requires the PHP [Imagick](http://pecl.php.net/package/imagick) extension

##What makes this generator unique
This motivator creates a motivational poster around your image. There is no need
to resize your image to fit a particular format

##Future Plans
- Add a resizing option in case your poster is smaller or larger than you would like
- Add a better GUI so that users can preview their poster before it's finalized
